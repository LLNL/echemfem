This code provides Finite Element solvers for electrochemical transport.
Both continuous Galerkin (CG) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes are provided. The DG scheme for electroneutral Nernst-Planck is described in [Roy et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111859). The CG scheme uses SUPG for the advection-migration term.

The following transport mechanisms are available: diffusion, advection, electromigration. EchemFEM supports both non-porous and porous cases. The ionic potential can either be described using an electroneutrality constraint or a Poisson equation. In the porous case, the electronic potential can be described by a Poisson equation.
Some finite size effects are also implemented. For example, the generalized modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck model (GMPNP) is used in the examples of [FireCat](https://github.com/LLNL/firecat), coupling in with a microkinetics model.
